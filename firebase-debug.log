You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  D:\Nov(Work)\website(nov 1)

[info] 
=== Project Setup
[info] 
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.
[info] 
[info] 
=== Database Setup
[info] 
[info] Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be
[info] structured and when your data can be read from and written to.
[info] 
[info] +  Database Rules for  have been downloaded to Y. 
[info] Future modifications to Y will update Database Rules when you run
[info] firebase deploy.
[info] 
=== Firestore Setup
[info] 
[info] Firestore Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
[info] requests. You can keep these rules in your project directory
[info] and publish them with firebase deploy.
[info] 
[info] 
[info] Firestore indexes allow you to perform complex queries while
[info] maintaining performance that scales with the size of the result
[info] set. You can keep index definitions in your project directory
[info] and publish them with firebase deploy.
[info] 
[info] 
=== Functions Setup
[info] 
[info] A functions directory will be created in your project with a Node.js
[info] package pre-configured. Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.
[info] 
[info] +  Wrote functions/package.json 
[info] +  Wrote functions/.eslintrc.json 
[info] +  Wrote functions/index.js 
[info] +  Wrote functions/.gitignore 
[info] 
=== Hosting Setup
[info] 
[info] Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
[info] will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
[info] have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.
